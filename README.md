# trunk

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bazelment/trunk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bazelment/trunk)


A collection of C++/Java opensource projects with BUILD files so they
can be easily built with [bazel](http://bazel.io).

To try:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mzhaom/trunk && cd trunk
$ git submodule update --init
$ bazel build examples/...
```

If you have used [docker](https://www.docker.com/) before, there is a
[docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bazelment/trunk/) that has
bazel installed with all the trunk source checked out, which can be
tried with:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -ti bazelment/trunk:lrte
$ bazel build examples/...
```

Currently C++ projects can be only built on Linux x64 system.
