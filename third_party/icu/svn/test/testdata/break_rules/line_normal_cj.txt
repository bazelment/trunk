# Reference Line Break rules for intltest rbbi/RBBIMonkeyTest

# Note: Rule syntax and the monkey test itself are still a work in progress.
#       They are expected to change with review and the addition of support for rule tailoring.
#
#         Line Breaking Rules
#         Implement default line breaking as defined by
#         Unicode Standard Annex #14 Revision 34 for Unicode 8.0
#         http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/
#         tailored as noted in 2nd paragraph below.
#
#         TODO:  Rule LB 8 remains as it was in Unicode 5.2
#         This is only because of a limitation of ICU break engine implementation,
#         not because the older behavior is desirable.
#
#         This tailors the line break behavior to correspond to CSS
#         line-break=normal (BCP47 -u-lb-normal) as defined for Chinese & Japanese.
#         It sets characters of class CJ to behave like ID.
#         In addition, it allows breaks:
#         * before hyphens 2010 & 2013 (both BA) and 301C, 30A0 (both NS)
